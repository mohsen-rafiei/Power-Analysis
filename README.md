# Outlier Detection Project

This project demonstrates how to use various advanced techniques for detecting outliers in a dataset. The included dataset has two features with synthetic outliers added to highlight the effectiveness of these methods.

## Overview

Outlier detection is critical for identifying unusual or anomalous data points in a dataset. This project implements multiple techniques for outlier detection, grouped into three main categories:

1. **Statistical Methods**:
   - **Z-Score**: Identifies data points far from the mean based on standard deviations.
   - **Elliptic Envelope**: Assumes a Gaussian distribution and identifies data points outside a confidence interval.

2. **Distance-Based Methods**:
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Flags points with high average distances to their nearest neighbors.
   - **Isolation Forest**: Uses a tree-based ensemble approach to isolate anomalies.

3. **Density-Based Methods**:
   - **DBSCAN**: Identifies outliers in low-density regions.
   - **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: Detects anomalies based on their local density relative to their neighbors.

## Files Included

1. **`outlier_detection_data.csv`**  
   - A dataset with 200 samples and 2 continuous features (`Feature_1` and `Feature_2`).  
   - Includes 10 synthetic outliers to demonstrate outlier detection techniques.

2. **`outlier_detection.Rmd`**  
   - An R Markdown file showcasing:
     - Implementation of statistical, distance-based, and density-based methods.
     - Comparison of methods to detect outliers.

## Steps to Run the Analysis

1. **Download the Files**:  
   Clone this repository or manually download the files.

2. **Install Required R Packages**:  
   Install the following R libraries:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "FNN", "mvtnorm", "dbscan", "DMwR", "robustbase", "isolationForest"))
   ```

3. **Open and Run the R Markdown File**:  
   Open `outlier_detection.Rmd` in RStudio. Knit it to generate an HTML report and explore the results of different techniques.

## Why Multiple Methods?

Outlier detection methods vary in their assumptions and suitability for different types of data:
- **Statistical Methods**: Simple and interpretable but limited for non-Gaussian data.
- **Distance-Based Methods**: Effective for datasets with clear clusters but computationally intensive for large datasets.
- **Density-Based Methods**: Handle local anomalies well but require tuning parameters like `eps` for DBSCAN.
